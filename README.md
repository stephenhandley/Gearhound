# Gear
Experiment in using GitHub repo to delegate from a custom [GPT](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) to more specialized GPTs based on a table in the README.

## GPTs

Below is a table of the supported gear, which the top level [Gear]() GPT uses to delegate based on the model / manufacturer.

| Manufacturer | Model | GPT | Site |
|---|---|---|---|
| Teenage Engineering | [PocketOperator(s)](/gpts/TeenageEngineering/PocketOperator.md) | [ðŸ”—](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-JaTV0oiZz-pocketoperator) | [ðŸ”—](https://teenage.engineering/products/po) |
| Teenage Engineering | OP-Z | [ðŸ”—]() | [ðŸ”—]() |
| Teenage Engineering | OP-1 | [ðŸ”—]() | [ðŸ”—](https://teenage.engineering/products/op-1/original) |
| Ableton | [Live 11](/gpts/Ableton/Live11.md) | [ðŸ”—]() | [ðŸ”—](https://www.ableton.com/en/manual/welcome-to-live/) |
| Ableton | Note | [ðŸ”—]() | [ðŸ”—]() |
| Ableton | [Push 3](/gpts/Ableton/Push3.md) | [ðŸ”—](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-tPZA8oaml-push3) | [ðŸ”—](https://www.ableton.com/en/push/manual/) |


## TODO: Contributing

I can't find any OpenAI API for creating / editing GPTs. Would be cool to eventually accept contributions and publish / modify the GPTs based on source in `/gpts/<manufacturer>/<model>.md`. For now its just stuff I've added, not even sure the delegation will work lol
