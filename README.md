# Gear
Experiment in using GitHub repo to delegate from a custom [GPT](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts) to more specialized GPTs based on a table in the README.

## GPTs

Below is a table of the supported gear, which the top level [Gear]() GPT uses to delegate based on the model / manufacturer.

## TODO: Contributing

I can't find any OpenAI API for creating / editing GPTs. Would be cool to eventually accept contributions and publish / modify the GPTs based on source in `/gpts/<manufacturer>/<model>.md`. For now its just stuff I've added, not even sure the delegation will work lol
